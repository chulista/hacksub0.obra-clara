## MILESTONE 2 PLAN: OBRA CLARA

**Team:** OBRA CLARA  

**Track:**

    [ ] SHIP-A-TON
    [X] IDEA-TON  

**Date:** 16/11/2025

## 📍 WHERE WE ARE NOW

**What we built/validated this weekend:**
- We were able to design the blockchain architecture for the solution.
- We analyzed and understood the monetary costs involved in using blockchain.
- We validated the blockchain component of the system's architecture.
- We validated the problem by interviewing additional stakeholders in the ecosystem.
- We refined the user flows based on real-world feedback.
- We confirmed technical feasibility for the core features of the MVP.

**What's working:**
- Our MVP is approximately 50% built.
- UI is functional:
	- User login and authentication
	- Document transcription using Gemini
	- Uploading of Service Orders and Request Notes (OS/NP)
	- Project/Works dashboard
	- Document storage
	- Smart search powered by Gemini

**What still needs work:**
- Replace the temporary Make-based back-end with a Node.js API connected to PostgreSQL
- Smart contract development.
- UI refinements and polishing.
- Build the complete RAG pipeline
- Implement role-based access management (RBAC)

**Blockers or hurdles we hit:**
- Need to incorporate a dedicated backend developer to accelerate the Node.js + PostgreSQL migration
- Still require a Web3 developer for smart contract implementation (future phase)

## 🚀 WHAT WE'LL SHIP IN 30 DAYS

**Our MVP will do this:**
- Automated digitalization of OS/NP through uploads of photos, PDFs, text, or voice.
- Immutable blockchain traceability, storing document hashes to guarantee authenticity and prevent tampering.
- AI-powered search, enabling users to find historical records, justify delays, audit processes, or generate reports in seconds.

### Features We'll Build (3-5 max)

**Week 1-2:**
- Feature: smart contracts para registrar hash de las ordenes de servicio y notas de pedido
- Why it matters: permite el registro en blockchain de los documentos para asegurar trazabilidad e inmutabilidad

**Week 2-3:**
- Feature: Automated alerts for deadlines and critical response windows.
- Why it matters: Alerta a los ingenieros de obra cuando deberían responder una orden de servicio antes de que esta se venza

**Week 3-4:**
- Feature: RAG pipeline
- Why it matters: sirve para que la IA pueda leer, entender y responder preguntas basadas en los documentos reales de la obra, en lugar de inventar o responder de forma genérica.


### Mentoring & Expertise We Need

**Areas where we need support:**
- Web 3 development

**Specific expertise we're looking for:**
- Smart contracts development

## 🎯 WHAT HAPPENS AFTER

**When M2 is done, we plan to...**
- Start testing the MVP with a construction company that is our strategic partner

**And 6 months out we see our project achieve:**
- The solution being used by 5 construction companies in Mendoza
- Starting development of the first pilot with the government of Mendoza
